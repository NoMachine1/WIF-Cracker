# 🚀 WIF Cracker: The Quest for Lost Bitcoins 🚀

Welcome to the most over-engineered, caffeine-fueled, and slightly unhinged attempt at cracking Bitcoin private keys. Why? Because we can. And because somewhere out there, Satoshi Nakamoto is laughing at us.

## 🤔 What is This?

This script is a multi-core, hyper-optimized, Numba-accelerated brute-force tool designed to find missing Bitcoin private keys. Think of it as the digital equivalent of searching for a needle in a haystack... except the haystack is the size of the observable universe.

---

## 💡 Features

- **Multi-Core Support**: Harness the power of all your CPU cores to maximize your chances of finding that elusive key.
- **Numba Magic**: Faster than a cheetah on Red Bull, thanks to parallelized Numba functions.
- **Randomness++**: Each core gets its own unique random seed, ensuring no duplicate keys are generated. No more "core envy" here!
- **Winner Logging**: When you hit the jackpot, your success is immortalized in `winner.txt`. Fame and fortune await!

---

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?

1. **Input**: You provide a partial WIF (Wallet Import Format) and a target Bitcoin address hash.
2. **Brute Force**: The script generates random WIF completions and checks if they match the target hash.
3. **BINGO!**: If a match is found, the script writes the private key to `winner.txt` and throws a virtual party.

## 🚨 WARNING

- **Ethical Use Only**: This script is intended for educational purposes and ethical use cases (e.g., recovering your own lost keys). Do NOT use it for evil. We're watching you.
- **Battery Killer**: Running this on a laptop will drain your battery faster than a kid opening Christmas presents.
- **No Guarantees**: Finding a private key is like winning the lottery... but harder. Good luck!

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `numba`
  - `ice_secp256k1`
  - `psutil`
- A computer with more cores than you have fingers.
- A healthy dose of optimism (and maybe some snacks).

## 🎉 Fun Facts
The total number of possible Bitcoin private keys is approximately 2^256. That's more than the number of atoms in the observable universe. Good luck!
